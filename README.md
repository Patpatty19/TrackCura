# TrackCura

This is an Android project (Gradle/Kotlin) created in Android Studio.

Quick start

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Build and run on a device or emulator.

How to publish this repository to GitHub

Option A (manual via GitHub website):
- Create a new repository on GitHub (do not initialize with a README).
- Then run the commands in your project root:

  git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
  git push -u origin main

Option B (using GitHub CLI - gh):
- Install GitHub CLI (https://cli.github.com/).
- From the project root run:

  gh repo create <your-username>/<repo> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

If you'd like, I can also set the remote and push for you — tell me the GitHub repo URL or give me the repo name and whether you want it public or private.
